# Priors with Differential Privacy

This repository contains code to perform the experiments in "Bayesian Inference Under Differential Privacy: Prior Selection Considerations with Application to Univariate Gaussian Data and Regression" (Kazan and Reiter, 2024). The file `code_for_paper.R` contains code to reproduce all figures in the paper, which can also be found in the `Figures` folder. This file uses runs saved to the `coverage analysis` folder to create Figures 2, 8, and 9, which are based on a simulation study run on a shared compute cluster. The code used to perform the simulation study and reproduce the saved runs is provided in `simulation_script.R`.
